        <div id='box'>F1 Goldendoodle (50% Poodle and 50% Golden Retriever) is the first generation Goldendoodle that is
            a
            cross
            between a purebred 100% Golden Retriever and a purebred 100% Standard Poodle. The result is a Goldendoodle
            that
            is
            50% Golden Retriever and 50% Poodle.

            The F1 Goldendoodle is the classic Goldendoodle that most people think about when they hear the term
            “Goldendoodle”.
            However, F1 Goldendoodle genetics can vary quite extensively which will affect how they look. For instance,
            they
            can
            have coats that shed and some coats that are non-shedding. In addition, these coats can be smooth like the
            Golden
            Retriever, wavy, or curly like the poodle.
            <br>
            <br>
            F1 Goldendoodles gain the most health benefits of being Hybrid Vigor, which means the first cross between
            two
            purebred dogs will be healthier than any parent purebred dog. This is because inbreeding causes genetic
            defects.
            Since Goldendoodles are a hybrid dog, they will only inherit genetic problems that are common to the
            Standard
            Poodle
            and Golden Retriever.
