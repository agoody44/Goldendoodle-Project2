    <div id='box'>The F1B Goldendoodle is 75% Poodle and 25% Golden Retriever. In order to get an F1B Goldendoodle, you
      need
      to breed an F1 Goldendoodle and backcross it with either a 100% Poodle or a 100% Golden Retriever. Almost always,
      a
      Goldendoodle breeder will choose to breed a F1 Goldendoodle with a 100% Poodle because of the nonshedding and
      hypoallergenic features. Breeding an F1 Goldendoodle (50% Poodle and 50% Golden Retriever) with a 100% Poodle
      yields
      an F1B Goldendoodle which is (75% Poodle and 25% Golden Retriever). See the image to the right for a visual
      explanation of an F1B Goldendoodle.
      <br>
      <br>
      The F1B Goldendoodle is the most popular Goldendoodle generation amongst breeders because it is more nonshedding
      and
      hypoallergenic than an F1 Goldendoodle. Since the F1B Goldendoodle is 75% Poodle, it has a significantly higher
      chance
      of a wavy or curly coat that doesn’t shed and is extremely hypoallergenic. These are more desirable features in a
      Goldendoodle which is why dog owners would elect for an F1B vs. F1 Goldendoodle.
      <br>
      <br>
      The downside of the F1B Goldendoodle is that they get less of the Hybrid Vigor trait than the F1 Goldendoodle.
      Since
      an F1B is technically a “2nd” generation crossbred, they will inherit less of this Hybrid Vigor trait. As the
      generation of Goldendoodle increases, the less the Hybrid Vigor trait they inherit.
