        <div id='box'>The second generation of Goldendoodles, F2, like their F1 parents are half Poodle and half Golden
            Retriever but are sired by hybrids instead of purebreds. ... The F2B Goldendoodles are 62.5% Poodle and only
            37.5%
            Golden Retriever with one F1 parent and one F1B parent.
            <br>
            <br>
            The F2 generations produce specimens that are somewhat similar to the F1 generation since they are the same
            percentage of Golden Retriever and Poodle. However, most breeders will not breed an F2 Goldendoodle due to
            this
            generation being the most unpredictable generation of genetics in terms of coat type, coat hair, and
            variation of
            shedding.

            F2 Goldendoodle Characteristics
            <br>
            Coat Type: Highly variable and unpredictable. Straight, wavy, or curly.
            <br>
            Hypoallergenic: Unpredictable.
            <br>
            Non-shedding: Unpredictable.
            <br>
            Hybrid Vigor: Yes, but less so than the F1 generation.
