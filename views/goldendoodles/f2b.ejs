        <div id='box'>F2B Goldendoodle (62.5% Poodle and 37.5% Golden Retriever) is a cross between an F1 Goldendoodle
            (50%
            Poodle, 50% Golden Retriever) and an F1B Goldendoodle (75% Poodle, 25% Golden Retriever). Alternatively,
            some
            breeders will choose to breed an F1B Goldendoodle and another F1B Goldendoodle which would result in the F2B
            being
            75% Poodle and 25% Golden Retriever.
            <br>
            <br>
            The F2B Goldendoodle generation is often referred to as a Multi-generation Goldendoodle since they are the
            3rd
            generation of offspring.
